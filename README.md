Jet Coding Assignment

Overview:

This repository contains my coding assignment for the Early Careers Software Development program 2025. This project answers the problem sent by Jet.

This project is built using Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/vue components(https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/introduction.html). I chose Vue.js because it is a reactive framework that works well with components, while Tailwind CSS makes styling applications more efficient, flexible and I like the way it is made for faster development. For some base components (card/button) I used shadcn/vue components because, even if pre-made, they are directly imported into the project, offering full control over the design, which allows for better customization and future maintainability.


Note: The incremental stages of the development(with all the important commits) can be found in the development branch.
